# Spotify Music Recommendation System
This project leverages the Spotify API and advanced machine learning techniques to create a system that provides personalized song recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.

## Introduction
In the age of digital music streaming, personalized recommendations have become crucial for enhancing user experience. This project aims to develop a recommendation system that suggests songs tailored to individual user tastes by analyzing their listening habits and song features.

## Features
1. *Personalized Recommendations:*
   - The system aims to suggest new tracks that align with their tastes and interaction with the platform such as songs played, liked, skipped etc. and continously update the recommendations as the user's listening habits evolve. 
2. *Hybrid Recommendation Model:*
   - Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide a more accuracte and diverse recommendation model that considers both user preferences and song features. 
3. *Audio Feature Analysis:*
   - Extract and analyse audio features such as key, tempo, danceability, energy, lyrics etc.
   - Build a comprehensive profile for each song to aid in the recommendation process. 

## Data Collection
### Sources
- *Spotify API:*
   - The Spotify API provides access to an extensive database of music and for the purpose of this project, we can gather detailed information about songs, artists, albums and user playlists. The API is rich in metadata which makes it suitable for building a robust recommendation system.
- *User Interaction Data:*
   - This will provide insights into user preferences and listening habits when using the platform and is essential for training collaborative filtering models when diverse information is available through the API.

## Data Processing
Data processing involves cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
### Steps
1. *Data Cleaning:*
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
2. *Normalization:*
   - Normalize features to ensure consistency.
3. *Feature Engineering:*
   - Create additional features and encode categorical variables.

## Model Development
1. *Collaborative Filtering:*
   - Utilizes user-item interaction data to recommend songs based on similar song preferences.
2. *Content-Based Filtering:*
   - Uses song features and metadata to recommend songs similar to those previously liked by the user.
3. *Hybrid Approach:*
   - Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendation accuracy.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. (Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness)
