# Spotify Music Recommendation System
This project leverages the Spotify API and advanced machine learning techniques to create a system that provides personalized song recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.

## Introduction
In the age of digital music streaming, personalized recommendations have become crucial for enhancing user experience. This project aims to develop a recommendation system that suggests songs tailored to individual user tastes by analyzing their listening habits and song features.

## Features
1. *Personalized Recommendations:* Suggest songs based on user listening history and preferences.
2. *Hybrid Recommendation Model:* Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
3. *Interactive Web Interface:* Allows users to interact with the system and receive real-time recommendations.
4. *Scalable Deployment:* Ready to be deployed on cloud platforms for handling large-scale user data.

## Data Collection
### Sources
- *Spotify API:* Used to collect song features (e.g., danceability, energy, loudness, tempo) and metadata (e.g., artist, album, genre).
- *User Interaction Data:* Synthetic data or real data (with user consent) on user playlists, ratings, and listening history.

## Data Processing
Data processing involves cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
### Steps
1. *Data Cleaning:* Handle missing values and duplicates.
2. *Normalization:* Normalize features to ensure consistency.
3. *Feature Engineering:* Create additional features and encode categorical variables.

## Model Development
1. *Collaborative Filtering:* Utilizes user-item interaction data to recommend songs based on similar song preferences.
2. *Content-Based Filtering:* Uses song features and metadata to recommend songs similar to those previously liked by the user.
3. *Hybrid Approach:* Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendation accuracy.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. (Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness)
